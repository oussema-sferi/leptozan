						<h3>Processing Orders</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="detail">
						<p>Your order will generally be prepared for shipment within 1-2 business days. Holiday periods may require extra processing time. Should there be any errors in your payment details or shipping address, you may experience additional delays of 3-5 business days.</p>
						<p><span class="make-bold">Important:</span> We validate all domestic shipping addresses through USPS. For accurate delivery, double-check your address at USPS.com (international orders excluded).</p>
						<p>Shipments go out on weekdays only (Monday through Friday), excluding American holidays.</p>
						<p>Please note that since orders require 1-2 business days for processing, Leptozan cannot be responsible for delivery delays. Additionally, we do not guarantee USPS delivery timeframes.</p>

						<h3>Domestic Delivery Times</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="detail">
						<p>Your package's arrival time depends on your selected shipping option and excludes weekends and holidays. Delivery timeframes are approximate, and Leptozan cannot accept responsibility for shipping delays resulting from factors outside our control, including severe weather, worker strikes, or shipping carrier disruptions.</p>

						<h3>Delivery of Items</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="detail">
						<p>If tracking shows your package was delivered but you haven't received it, we cannot provide a refund. In these situations, you'll need to work directly with USPS to resolve the issue.</p>

						<h3>Refused, Lost, Stolen, or Delayed Packages</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="detail">
						<p>For any package refused upon delivery, we'll subtract the shipping costs from your refunded amount. We'll process your refund for refused deliveries only after our staff receives and examines the returned items.</p>
						<p>We deliver most packages through UPS. While we regret that we cannot replace items lost or stolen during UPS transit, please reach out to us at leptozan.com if you encounter any shipping problems or delays. We cannot assume responsibility for packages that are lost, stolen, or delayed during transit.</p>
						<p><span class="make-bold">For international orders:</span> Some countries may experience delivery times of 4-6 weeks, and occasionally extend to 8-12 weeks. We are not responsible for any customs-related delays in your destination country. Due to location, certain countries may incur extra shipping charges.</p>

						<h3>Cancellation of Orders</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="detail">
						<p>Due to high order volume, once placed, your order goes directly into our fulfillment process. If you need to cancel, please contact us within 24 hours of purchase. Orders cannot be canceled if they have already been processed or shipped. If the order has shipped, you may refuse the package or return it to us with a valid tracking number, and notify us for a refund upon receipt.</p>

						<h3>Wrong Address</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="detail">
						<p>You must ensure your shipping address is accurate when placing your order. We cannot take responsibility for deliveries sent to wrong addresses that you provide. Once an order is processed or shipped, we cannot modify the delivery address. If your package returns to us due to an incorrect address, you can choose to either have it reshipped or receive a refund.</p>
